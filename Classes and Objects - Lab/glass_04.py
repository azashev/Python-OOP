# Create a class called Glass.
# Upon initialization, it will not receive any parameters.
# You must create an instance attribute called content which should be equal to 0.
# You should also create a class attribute called capacity which should be 250 ml. Create 3 instance methods:
# - fill(ml) - fills the glass with the given milliliters if there is enough space in it and return:
#   "Glass filled with {ml} ml", otherwise returns "Cannot add {ml} ml"
# - empty() - empties the glass and returns:
#   "Glass is now empty"
# - info() - returns info about the glass in the format:
#   "{space_left} ml left"
#
#
# Test code:
glass = Glass()
print(glass.fill(100))
print(glass.fill(200))
print(glass.empty())
print(glass.fill(200))
print(glass.info())

#
# Expected output:
# Glass filled with 100 ml
# Cannot add 200 ml
# Glass is now empty
# Glass filled with 200 ml
# 50 ml left
