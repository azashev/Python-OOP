# Create a class called SteamUser. Upon initialization, it should receive a username (string) and games (list).
# It should also have an attribute called played_hours (0 by default). Add three methods to the class:
# - play(game, hours)
#   - If the game is in the game list, increase the played_hours by the given hours and return:
#       "{username} is playing {game}"
#   - Otherwise, return:
#       "{game} is not in library"
# - buy_game(game)
#   - If the game is not in the game list, add it and return:
#       "{username} bought {game}"
#   - Otherwise, return:
#       "{game} is already in your library"
# -	status() - returns the following:
#     "{username} has {games_count} games. Total play time: {played_hours}"
#
#
# Test code:
user = SteamUser("Peter", ["Rainbow Six Siege", "CS:GO", "Fortnite"])
print(user.play("Fortnite", 3))
print(user.play("Oxygen Not Included", 5))
print(user.buy_game("CS:GO"))
print(user.buy_game("Oxygen Not Included"))
print(user.play("Oxygen Not Included", 6))
print(user.status())

#
# Expected output:
# Peter is playing Fortnite
# Oxygen Not Included is not in library
# CS:GO is already in your library
# Peter bought Oxygen Not Included
# Peter is playing Oxygen Not Included
# Peter has 4 games. Total play time: 9
