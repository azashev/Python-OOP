# Create a class named Music that receives title (string), artist (string), and lyrics (string) upon initialization.
# The class should also have two additional methods:
# • The print_info() method should return the following: 'This is "{title}" from "{artist}"'
# • The play() method should return the lyrics.
#
#
# Test code:
song = Music("Title", "Artist", "Lyrics")
print(song.print_info())
print(song.play())

#
# Expected output:
# This is "Title" from "Artist"
# Lyrics
